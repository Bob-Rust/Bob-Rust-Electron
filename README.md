# Bob Rust Electron
We still need to fully automate this with https://github.com/sekwah41/primitive however this is the starts of a new painting application for rust which paints pictures relatively fast.

The results will get faster and higher quality re-creations as we fine-tune the code though obviously there is a limit :P

## Currently In Development
This is just a quick note to state that this program is currently in heavy development.

## Building
To build this you will need to make sure you have installed yarn. You can get this using `npm install -g yarn`.
Once you have that running `yarn` in the  main directory should set everything up for you.

To build a distributable version of the project just run `yarn electron-dist`.

There will be warnings at the moment linked to the nsis building due to publishing options though you can ignore those.

## Auto Building
Currently, there is a github actions setup however will likely need altering for the new setup as a lot has changed.
Though this can all wait until the program is fully functional.
